# Earth Observation Notebooks

## Jupyter notebooks
A Jupiter notebook is a research document containing live code, annotated write-ups and descriptions of analyses or research.    

A Jupyter notebook aims to make research re-producible and re-usable by offering a common programmatic interface whereby all diagrams, tables, plots are results of inline executed code. 

Being able to read the code that generates results adds full transparency to research as well as promotes the adoption and re-use of that research.  

## This repository

This repository houses various Jupyter notebooks from the open data cube community. A varied community of remote sensing, GIS, and earth observation specialists/researchers. 

The [open data cube](https://www.opendatacube.org/) is used in these notebooks to query large data-sets for time series rasters on which analysis is conducted.
